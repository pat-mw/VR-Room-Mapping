VR Room Mapping

This is a personal project - built in Unity using a custom OSC networking solution and Normcore Networking - which allows you to map out your real-space and send the information back to Unity, and then enter the virtual representation of your space in VR with other friends.

This is the basis for a multiplayer XR experience using the Oculus Quest
